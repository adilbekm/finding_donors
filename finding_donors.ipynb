    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try the following 3 learning models for this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "    * One of the real-world applications of this model is natural language processing, such as spam detection. It is used to classify emails as spam or not spam after training on a sample of emails that are known to be spam or not spam. \n",
    "    * The strengths of this model is it's simplicity and speed. It is easy to implement and fast to train and to make predictions. \n",
    "    * The weaknesses are, again, the simplicity (the model ignores any dependencies between features or words in the case of natural language processing).\n",
    "    * The speed of implementation makes this model a good candidate. Other models will probably perform better in terms of their accuracy, but even then this model can be a good benchmark (the minimum we should expect from the more complex models).\n",
    "2. Decision Trees:\n",
    "    * Decision trees are used for recommender systems such as those used by Amazon and Netflix to recommend new products and films.\n",
    "    * Decision trees perform well on large datasets. They also easier to understand because they mimic human decision making process.\n",
    "    * Decision trees are easy to grow very complex and therefore overfit to the data. If this happens, they don't generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "    * This problem may be good for decision trees because the large number of features will be relatively easy to handle for decision trees. I will try to control its overfitting tendency by tuning its parameters.\n",
    "3. Support Vector Machine (SVM):\n",
    "    * Hand-written character recognition is one real-world example of the SVM application. Here, the model is trained using many images of hand-written characters with the correct labels for each images (which character the image represents), then the trained model is applied to unseen images. \n",
    "    * SVM models generalize better to unseen data. They also perform better compared to other models when the training sets are small.\n",
    "    * The weaknesses of SVM are probably non-linear models. While a kernel trick can be applied to SVM to classify data, the kernel trick usually results in bigger generalization error.\n",
    "    * SVM would be a good candidate for this problem because it can still be effective with datasets with large number of features (high-dimensional space). With 103 features in this CharityML dataset after one-hot encoding, SVM will be less likely to overfit compared to other algorithms, and can still produce a model that generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "References:\n",
    "* http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html\n",
    "* Udacity's machine learning nanodegree (core curriculum as well as the new content, under Extracurricular)\n",
    "* Wikipedia pages for each of the algorithms\n"

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "SVM and DecisionTreeCLassifier (DT) both seem to be good models for CharityML for different reasons. SVM has a slightly better F-score on the testing set compared to DT: approximately 0.66 vs. 0.62, respectively. On the training set, DT appears to have a better F-score at first look but because it is is nearly perfect at 0.95 or higher, DT is probably just overfitting there. On the other hand, SVM's computational cost seems much higher at nearly 2 minutes of training time and another 20 seconds of prediction time. For DT, those times are practically instant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above pros and cons, I am inclined to go with DT. This is because I am placing more weight on the issue of training and prediction times because it would be amplified at a later step, GridSearchCV. There, we will have to perform multiple train/evaluation cycles to optimize the model so the execution time may become a real issue. (If I had a faster computer, however, I would probably choose SVM because it appears to generalize better than DT).\n",

    "The Decision Tree model that I am choosing for CharityML will work as follows. We will take the US Census data and use 80% of it for training. The model will look at each of the features in the training set, such as *age*, *education*, etc., and will gauge the importance of each feature based on how well they split the data into the 2 categores (<=50K and >50K). The model will then build a tree of questions starting with the question that involves the most important feature - for example, if the feature is *age* then the question could be, \"Is the person over the age of 25?\". The model will determine the threshhold of 25 in this question by finding the point that best splits the data. When the tree is fully built, all branches will eventually lead to one of the two answers - the person makes more than $50K or not.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
